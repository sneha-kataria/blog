### **Hypothesis structure:**

The top-ranked problem from rice framework was delivery inefficiency but that requires more time and resources. So, considering hyperlocal product discovery and recommendation as the key problem to solve here.

### Clear problem statement:

Users struggle in finding products locally when the platform shows a generic range of products that are not personalized based on the user‚Äôs preferences and shopping history while heavily promoting the sponsored products. Users also feel dejected when the ambiguous products shows up in the search results which makes the product discovery more time consuming.

### Impact on Users:

This problem leads to user disappointment. Personalised recommendations at the top of the search results can save time and make the process quick and easy for the user. Searching for locally available products and getting vague results leads to confusion in user experience resulting in user ordering items which are not available immediately.

### Primary target users:

Frequent urban and rural shoppers: Prefers to shop online more than 3 ‚Äì 4 times a week and aged between 18-45 years. They choose convenience and time saved over in-store shopping.

## Value Proposition:

For users, our MVP provides improved search results with AI- personalized recommendations of locally available products based on user preferences and search history. Using real time delivery updates from optimized routes to manage user frustration, resulting in more efficient and a customised shopping experience.
